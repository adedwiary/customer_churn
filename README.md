# Customer Churn Prediction
***
* Created artificial neural network model to predict weather or not a customer will cancel a subscription (churn).
* Managed to receive a validation accuracy of over 81%.
* Used the Telco Customer Churn Dataset.

## The Telco Customer Churn Dataset
The data consists of 7043 rows and 21 columns. with the following labels:
* **Customers who left within the last month:** the column is called Churn
* **Basic information about customers:** gender, senior citizen, and if they have partners and dependents
* **Services that each customer has signed up for:** phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
* **Customer account information:** how long theyâ€™ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.

# Code and Resources used
***
* **Tool:** Google Colaboratory
* **Packages:** Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn
* **Multiclass Weather Dataset** : https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. 


# Findings
* Used dropout method to reduce overfitting by the trained model.
* Improved knowledge about Artificial Neural Networks and deep learning in general.
* Managed to obtain an accuracy close to 81%.
